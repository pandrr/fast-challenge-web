you are invited to produce a track for this challenge!

we are organizing a reoccuring competition called "fast challenge"
it's basically a thing where you have to make a one minute demo in one day, theme keywords are randomized and music is provided and people can concentrate on making the demo.

in future events we also want to select a random track out of a pool of songs.

it is not guaranteed when it will be used, but we want to organize it for many demoparties.

be aware, that there is a risk of "bad demos" being released with your track.
please think about this: the goal of this challenge is to get more people into the habbit of making more demos! so it should not be artificially hard to make a demo for your soundtrack...

- the track should be around 1 to 1:30 minutes
- it would be great to have midi file containing important sync points to make life easier for the democreator
- mp3/ogg format
- genre is totally up to you
- name of the file should contain title and author (or alias)

the next challenge will be for mountain bytes (25th february)
